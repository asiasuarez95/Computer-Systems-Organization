The segmentation fault occurs on lines 55- 59 within the for loop. 
Essentially, the for loop iterates from a smaller number to a larger number, so when it calls the instert method,  it falls under the else 
statement on line 29, which calls the function recursively n times. each call is saved on the stack which is not large enough to store all of the calls.

The stack frame is roughly around 140 bytes. The total avaliable stack size is 8192kb. 8192000/140 = 58514 calls that the stack can handle. 
In all actuallity, the program was able to successfully run 58223 times without a segmentation. As you can see, 58223  is extremely close to the predicted
58514.
