Linked list is, in essence, a double pointer. The node points to itself for the data reference, and the pointer (next) points to the next node.
So, in order to use a single pointer, we would need to return a new pointer to add, as there would be no way to change the head/node pointer directly.

In the current implementation, there is a line 
*head = node;

This however, would not be allowed if we use a single pointer, as
head would be a single pointer, and dereferenced pointer would not be able to hold the node, which would be another single pointer.
