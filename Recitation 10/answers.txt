gcc -c -o list.o list.c -std=gnu99 
-> produces no error
gcc -c -o main.o main.c -std-gnu99
-> main file's forloop declaration has 
	for(int i = 0; ...)
     however, the int i must be declared outside, before forloop so that
     int i;
     for(i = 0; ...)
 ->also, insert(int n), delete(int n) functions are from list.c
     therefore, must put #include "list.h"

#running nm ./linkedlist
delete, find, and insert are no longer undefined
assert, free, malloc are still undefined -> imported from the standard library headers
__libc_start_main, __printf_chk are undefined -> from the standard libary headers

shared library
	libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 (0x00007f86fd21b000)
	permission denied when I try
	nm -D libc.so.6 => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6

#fixing code
	since the n_inserts and n_deletes were originally defined as float, then in main defined as int, the interpretation causes the bitmap to read different value.
therefore, I changed int declaration to float in main, and later printing %d to %lf.
